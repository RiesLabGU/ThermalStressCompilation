I wrote really quick code to get the percentage of each interval above and below the optimum - it's shown below using the new dataset and the P metric, though it could easily be used for the S and D metrics. It ended up being really simple, given the new summary table!


```{r}
# load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```


```{r}
#Anna's Laptop

data <- read_csv("~/Desktop/ThermalResponsesII.csv")

head(data)
```

```{r}
data$belowPopt <- ((abs(data$Plower - data$Popt)) / (data$Pwidth))
data$abovePopt <- ((data$Pupper - data$Popt) / (data$Pwidth))

head(data)
```
