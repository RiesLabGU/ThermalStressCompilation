# Create graphs showing survival and development time vs. temperature for all of the data
# Faceted/subsetted by family and/or lifestage
# Each set would be an individual curve 
# Determine which datasets contain high enough temperatures to see a decline in survival / increase in development time
# This will help us determine what sorts of curves we should be fitting later on
# This could be mechanistically achieved by seeing if survival is highest (or development time is lowest) at the last temperature measured for each set
# In those datasets that do include high temperatures, identify whether survival rate starts dropping before development time starts increasing
# We're not sure development time will ever start increasing - the organisms might just die
