# Methods
We compiled a database including records of development time and/or survival  of Lepidoptera growing at constant temperatures. The full table includes `r length(unique(Ana$set))` sets of `r length(unique(Ana$sp))` species from `r length(unique(Ana$family))` families from `r length(unique(Ana$locality))` localities. See supplementary information for a full list of species.
Using linear interppolation we calculated the following variables in all complete sets (curves including both a rise and a fall) for development rate (n = `r length(d_complete_sets$set)`) and for survival (n = `r length(s_complete_sets$set)`)

dTopt: temperature that maximizes development rate

max_sTopt: maximum temperature that maximizes survival, 

min_sTopt: minimum temperature maximizing survival

dBreadth: interval of temperatures permiting >= 50% development efficiency

sBreadth: interval of temperatures permiting >= 50% survival

P: survival*development (fitness)

Figure 1A. Development rate (1/development time) of  `r set_w$sp [[1]]` `r set_w$lifestage [[1]]`s kept at constant temperatures. Line indicates a linear regression including only the treatments in which development rate has a linear relationship with temperature (solid points). T0 is estimated as the x-intercept of this relationship (9.7 C). The shaded region indicates the interval of temperatures at which development is assumed to occur.

Figure 1D. Performance (P, solid line) is the result of multipliying survival (triangles, dashed line) by development rate (points, dashed line). Shaded region denotes the interval of temperatures that allows for at least 50% survival and 50% development efficiency. This interval can be split into sub-optimal temperatures (below Popt, ligth grey) and supra-optimal temperatures, (above Popt, dark grey) 
Performance of `r unique(set_w$sp)` (`r unique(set_w$family)`), from `r unique(set_w$locality)`

Other descriptive stats of the data set

```{r}
Temps_by_set <- Ana %>% 
  select(set, temp) %>% 
  group_by(set) %>% 
  tally(sort = T)
```

Each set is a unit including `r min(Temps_by_set$n)` to `r max (Temps_by_set$n)`  constant temperature treatments (mode = `r which.max(tabulate(Temps_by_set$n))`) and the corresponding values of development time and/or survival.


```{r}
non_redundant_sets <- Ana %>% 
  select(id, sp, lifestage,locality) %>%
  distinct()  
  
  
  
```

There are multiple sets per population in this database because performance was often evaluated under a variety of experimental conditions including different host plants or daylengths, in addition, data was sometimes reported by sex. We considered sets from the same locality and ontogenetic stage that were reported in the same study (publication) to be redundant and thus combined them by taking the geometric mean at each temperature treatment. After this correction we had `r nrow(non_redundant_sets)` non-redundant sets.
